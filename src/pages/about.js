      <p>
        Aspiring Minds Educational Intervention (Aspiring Minds) has emerged
        from experience gleaned over 40 years of teaching and observing young
        people learn and develop both within and outside classroom situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a passion for teaching, our Principal, Meredith Ryals, recognises
        the benefit to young people of exposure to a holistic learning
        environment. Each student is recognised as a unique individual and
        treated as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Aspiring Minds, students are provided with a positive and safe
        environment, with clear boundaries for discipline. We recognise the
        benefit of applying principles of consistency and fairness within a
        framework of honesty, integrity and authenticity which builds a
        respectful and tolerant atmosphere among the students and between the
        students and staff. The improvement in studentsâ€™ self-esteem and
        confidence is extremely gratifying to all involved.
