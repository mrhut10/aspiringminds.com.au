            We recognise the benefit of applying principles of consistency and
            fairness within a framework of honesty, integrity and authenticity
            which builds a respectful and tolerant atmosphere among the students
            and between the students and staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            The improvement in studentsâ€™ self-esteem and confidence is extremely
            gratifying to all involved.
